# team-newsletter
A Wordpress plugin for managing and emailing a subscriber list your Wordpress posts.

The primary functionality is to allow post authors to email their posts to a subscriber list via a radio button near the "publish" button.

The admin panel provides various settings and the ability to manage subscribers (either add/delete them, view the current count, etc.).

AJAX-powered subscribe/unsubscribe functionality is provided through [user_subscribe_form] and [user_unsubscribe_form] shortcodes.
